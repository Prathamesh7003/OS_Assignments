    Functionality:
        Changing File Offset: The primary purpose of lseek() is to change the current file offset within a file opened by the process.
        Seeking to Specific Positions: It allows seeking to a specific byte offset within the file, either relative to the beginning, current position, or end of the file.
        Moving Relative to Current Position: The offset can be adjusted relative to the current position, which means moving forward or backward from the current offset.
        Handling Special Offsets: Special offset values, such as SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, and SEEK_END, are used to specify the reference point for seeking within the file.

    Benefits:
        Random Access: lseek() enables random access to files by allowing processes to set the file offset to any desired position within the file.
        Support for Large Files: It provides support for large files by allowing processes to access different parts of the file without reading or writing the entire file sequentially.
        Efficiency: Random access to file data can improve the efficiency of file operations, especially for large files, by avoiding unnecessary reads or writes.
        Position Tracking: lseek() allows processes to keep track of their current position within the file, which is useful for tasks such as reading or writing data at specific locations.

Overall, the lseek() system call is essential for file manipulation operations in Unix-like systems, providing flexibility, efficiency, and support for various file access patterns, including sequential and random access.
